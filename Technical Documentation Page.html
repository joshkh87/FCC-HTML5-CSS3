      <p>Hypertext Markup Language otherwise known as HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.The HTML syntax and typography was originally used in printed newspapers to deliniate how, and where to display the text on the ink plate, that was later used to print the parenthetical.</p>

      <p>You should learn the basics of HTML before attempting any CSS. We recommend that you work through our Introduction to HTML module first. In that module, you will learn about:</p>
      <p>HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages. </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. </li>
        <li>Many of the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents.</li>
        <li>However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure and markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.</li>
      </ul>

      <header>HTML Versions</header>
      <p>There are 4 cardinal Versions of HTML</p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML 2</li>
        <li>HTML 3</li>
        <li>HTML 4</li>
        <li>HTML 5</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>HTML 2</h3>
      <p>
        <li>November 24, 1995 HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:</li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>November 25, 1995: RFC 1867 (form-based file upload)</li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>May 1996: RFC 1942 (tables)</li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>August 1996: RFC 1980 (client-side image maps)</li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>January 1997: RFC 2070 (internationalization)</li>
      </p>

      <h4>HTML 3</h4>
      <p>
        <li>January 14, 1997</li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>HTML 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation. </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.</li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>Initially code-named "Wilbur", HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies. </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in HTML was not standardized until 14 months later in MathML.</li>
      </p>

      <h4>HTML 4</h4>
      <p>
        <li>December 18, 1997 HTML 4.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation.</li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>It offers three variations:Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden
          Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed</li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.</li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>Initially code-named "Cougar", HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but at the same time sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in favor of style sheets.</li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO 8879 – SGML.</li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>April 24, 1998 HTML 4.0 was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.</li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>December 24, 1999 HTML 4.01 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last errata were published on May 12, 2001.</li>
      </p>
      <p>
      <p>
        <li>May 2000 ISO/IEC 15445:2000 ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard. In the ISO this standard falls in the domain of the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34 (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document description and processing languages).</li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>After HTML 4.01, there was no new version of HTML for many years as development of the parallel, XML-based language XHTML occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group through the early and mid-2000s.</li>
      </p>

      <h4>HTML 5</h4>
      <p>
        <li>October 28, 2014 HTML5 was published as a W3C Recommendation.</li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>November 1, 2016 HTML 5.1 was published as a W3C Recommendation.</li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>December 14, 2017 HTML 5.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation.</li>

      HTML uses TAGS to mark webpages.
      <ul>
        <li>

          </h4>
          A Document Type Declaration, or DOCTYPE for short, is an instruction to the web browser about the version of markup language in which a web page is written. A DOCTYPE declaration appears at the top of a web page before all other elements.

        <li>

          <li>
            <h4>
